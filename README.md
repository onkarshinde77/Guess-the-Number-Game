# Guess-the-Number-Game
a number guessing game is a basic game in which the computer creates a random number and the player attempts to guess it within a specific range. Here's a quick rundown of how it works:
1) The game begins with the computer creating a random number within a given range (for example, between 1 and 100).
2) The following number is guessed by the player: The participant is asked to enter their best prediction for the random number.
3) Contrast the following guesses: The computer then compares the player's guess against the number created at random.
